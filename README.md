# Health Misinformation Detection Project

This project aims to create a robust model for detecting fake health news, with a primary focus on COVID-19 misinformation and testing whether these models can generalize to other misleading health claims.

## Key Features

- Advanced NLP techniques for health misinformation detection
- Traditional ML and transformer-based approaches
- Beautiful visualizations of model performance
- Cross-domain transfer learning analysis

## Getting Started

1. Run the simplified analysis to generate visualizations:
   ```bash
   cd project/report
   python run_simplified.py
   ```

2. The enhanced models are available in:
   - `project/enhanced_models.py` - Traditional ML with advanced visualizations
   - `project/advanced_transformers.py` - BERT, zero-shot and few-shot approaches
   - `project/cross_domain_transfer.py` - Testing cross-domain generalization

## Data

This project uses datasets related to COVID-19 misinformation, including:
- COVID-19 Fake News Dataset (Kaggle)
- CoAID (COVID-19 Healthcare Misinformation Dataset)

## Authors

- Santiago von Straussburg
